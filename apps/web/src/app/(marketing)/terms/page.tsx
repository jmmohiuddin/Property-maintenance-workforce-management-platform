        <LegalSection title="Who these terms are between">
          <p>
            These terms apply between you and {tenant.legalName}, trading as {tenant.brandName},
            registered in {tenant.address.city}, {tenant.address.country}. They apply whenever we quote
            for or carry out work for you, unless a signed contract between us says otherwise, in which
            case that contract takes precedence.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Quotations">
          <ul>
            <li>Quotations are valid for 30 days from issue unless the quotation states otherwise.</li>
            <li>
              Quotations are itemised, and anything not covered is listed as an exclusion on the
              quotation itself rather than added later.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where work uncovers something the survey could not reasonably have found, we stop and
              issue a revised quotation. We do not proceed and invoice you for the difference.
            </li>
            <li>Prices exclude VAT unless stated. VAT is shown separately on the invoice.</li>
          </ul>

        <LegalSection title="Call-outs and pricing">
          <ul>
            <li>
              A standard call-out covers attendance and the first 30 minutes of labour. Emergency
              call-outs cover attendance and the first hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no night, weekend or public holiday surcharge on the call-out fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where we cannot resolve the fault and carry out no work, there is no charge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Materials and any labour beyond the included period are quoted to you and require your
              approval before we proceed.

        <LegalSection title="Access and safety">
          <ul>
            <li>
              You are responsible for providing safe access to the property at the agreed time,
              including any building permissions, escorts or parking access required.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where we attend and cannot gain access, we may charge the call-out fee. We will always
              contact you before leaving.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our technicians will stop work and report to you if they find a condition that is unsafe
              to work on. We will not proceed with work we consider unsafe.

        <LegalSection title="Payment">
          <ul>
            <li>Ad-hoc work is payable on completion unless you hold an account with agreed terms.</li>
            <li>Account customers are invoiced on the terms stated on the invoice, typically 30 days.</li>
            <li>Contract fees are payable on the billing frequency stated in the contract.</li>
            <li>
              We may suspend further work on overdue accounts. We will tell you before doing so, and we
              will not suspend attendance at a genuine emergency on that basis.

        <LegalSection title="Our workmanship warranty">
          <ul>
            <li>
              We warrant our workmanship for 90 days from completion on general repairs. Where a longer
              period applies, it is stated on the quotation. Waterproofing carries a workmanship
              warranty of up to 10 years, conditional on the substrate and drainage falls being sound,
              both of which we assess before quoting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parts and materials carry their manufacturer's warranty. We pass that through and will
              handle the claim on your behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
              The warranty does not cover damage caused by misuse, third-party work after ours, or
              conditions we identified in writing and you chose not to address.
            </li>
            <li>
              If our work fails within the warranty period, we return and put it right at no charge.

              What a contract covers and what it excludes is set out on the contract itself. Exclusions
              are listed plainly, not buried.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contracts do not cover parts and materials, major plant replacement, or damage caused by
              misuse or third parties, unless the contract states otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contracts transfer to a new address within our service areas at no charge, or to a new
              owner of the same property. Unused preventive visits carry over.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a contract auto-renews, that is stated on the contract along with the notice period.

          {/*
            "third-party public liability insurance to AED 10,000,000" was a
            figure nobody held a policy for, published in a document a customer
            may later rely on in a dispute. WEB-2 removes it rather than
            replacing it with "fully insured", which asserts the same thing with
            less information and is no easier to stand behind.

            HR-14 builds a company accreditation register holding the real
            policies with their cover levels and expiry dates. When there is a
            certificate on file, the figure comes back — read from that register
            rather than typed into a paragraph.
          */}
          <p>
            We are responsible for damage caused by our own negligence. Current insurance certificates,
            including public liability and workmen&apos;s compensation cover, are provided on request and
            with any tender or contract submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for pre-existing defects we did not cause, for consequential loss such
            as loss of business or rental income, or for failures of equipment we did not install or
            maintain. Nothing in these terms limits liability where the law does not permit it to be
            limited.

        <LegalSection title="Cancellation">
          <p>
            You may cancel or reschedule a booked appointment at no charge up to 4 hours before the
            agreed time. Later than that, we may charge the call-out fee, because the slot and the
            technician are already committed.

            Contact <a href={`mailto:${tenant.email}`}>{tenant.email}</a> or call{" "}

            within five. If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can ask for it to be escalated to
            a director.
